# Project 1 - College Recruitment Improvement
# This program performs exploratory data analysis on a survey dataset collected from students enrolled in entry-level computing classes and computer literacy courses at the CCM Department of Information Technologies. The goal is to identify trends related to student demographics, enrollment periods, and motivations for taking these courses. By analyzing this data, the program helps inform the department's recruitment strategy, particularly to target successful areas and increase diversity, focusing on under-represented groups. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and the generation of actionable insights to enhance recruitment efforts.
